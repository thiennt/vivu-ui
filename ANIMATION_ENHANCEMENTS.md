# CardBattleEffects Animation Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the `CardBattleEffects` class with advanced visual animations to provide more engaging and impactful battle feedback.

## New Visual Effects Added

### 1. **Radial Glow Effects**
- Creates expanding circular glows around characters
- Used in healing, damage, and debuff animations
- Provides a sense of energy and power
- Colors adapt to effect type (red for damage, green for healing, purple for debuffs)

### 2. **Particle Burst System**
- Dynamically generated particle effects
- Particles scatter outward from impact point
- Used for critical hits (12 particles) and healing effects (8-10 particles)
- Each particle has randomized trajectory and fade-out timing

### 3. **Impact Wave Effects**
- Expanding circular waves emanating from characters
- Multiple wave layers for enhanced visual depth
- Used for damage impacts and debuff applications
- Waves fade out as they expand, creating a ripple effect

### 4. **Screen Shake Animation**
- Container-level shake effect for dramatic moments
- Configurable intensity and duration
- Follows realistic physics with diminishing oscillation
- Public method `shakeScreen()` available for external use

### 5. **Screen Flash Effect**
- Full-screen flash overlay for critical moments
- Configurable color, intensity, and duration
- Quick fade-in and slower fade-out for dramatic impact
- Public method `animateScreenFlash()` available

### 6. **Enhanced Energy Animation**
- Improved energy increase effect with dual-layer glow
- Inner glow circle + outer expanding ring
- Bounce effect with elastic ease for satisfying feedback
- Glow expands and fades simultaneously

## Animation Improvements by Skill Type

### Damage Skills
**Before:** Simple scale and red overlay
**After:**
- Radial red glow that expands
- Forward thrust with rotation
- Enhanced color intensity
- Smooth return animation

### Healing Skills
**Before:** Basic pulse and green overlay
**After:**
- Green radial glow with expanding effect
- 10 particle burst that floats upward
- Multiple pulse waves
- Sparkle effect simulation

### Debuff Skills
**Before:** Shake with purple overlay
**After:**
- Dual-wave impact effect (purple waves)
- Radial glow matching debuff color
- Enhanced shake sequence
- Wave fade-out for depth

### Target Damage Effects
**Before:** Recoil and shake with red flash
**After:**
- Impact wave on hit
- 12-particle critical hit burst (for crits)
- Enhanced shake intensity for crits
- Elastic bounce-back for satisfying feedback

### Target Healing Effects
**Before:** Gentle scale and green overlay
**After:**
- Large radial glow (80px radius)
- 8 floating particles rising upward
- Gentle pulsing animation
- Longer, more visible effect duration

### Target Debuff Effects
**Before:** Simple oscillation with overlay
**After:**
- Wave effect with expanding rings
- Radial glow matching effect type
- Enhanced oscillation pattern
- Multiple visual layers for depth

## Technical Implementation Details

### Helper Methods Created
1. `createRadialGlow(container, color, radius)` - Creates circular glow effects
2. `createParticleBurst(container, color, count)` - Generates particle effects
3. `createImpactWave(container, color)` - Creates expanding ring effects
4. `animateScreenShake(container, intensity, duration)` - Screen shake implementation

### Animation Timing
- All animations use GSAP timelines for smooth coordination
- Effects are layered with offset timing for visual depth
- Particle animations run independently for natural feel
- Cleanup is automatic with `onComplete` callbacks

### Performance Considerations
- Graphics objects are properly destroyed after use
- Particles are cleaned up individually
- No memory leaks with proper disposal
- Minimal performance impact due to efficient GSAP usage

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Existing API)
```typescript
// Character performs healing skill
await CardBattleEffects.animateCharacterSkill(characterCard, 'healing');

// Target receives damage
await CardBattleEffects.applyTargetEffect(targetCard, target, 'damage');
```

### New Public Methods
```typescript
// Screen shake on critical hit
await CardBattleEffects.shakeScreen(sceneContainer, 8);

// Screen flash on special ability
await CardBattleEffects.animateScreenFlash(sceneContainer, 0xFFFFFF, 0.7, 0.3);

// Enhanced energy increase
await CardBattleEffects.animateEnergyIncrease(energyText);
```

## Visual Impact Summary

The enhancements provide:
- **More satisfying feedback** - Players feel the impact of actions
- **Better visual clarity** - Different effect types are more distinguishable
- **Enhanced immersion** - Animations feel more game-like and polished
- **Improved juice** - The game feels more responsive and alive

## Browser Compatibility
All effects use standard PixiJS Graphics and GSAP, ensuring compatibility across:
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- No special GPU features required

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
- Screen space effects (distortion, chromatic aberration)
- Trail effects for character movement
- Custom particle shapes (stars, sparkles, runes)
- Sound effect integration triggers
- Combo multiplier visual feedback
